# SICI
SICI is a simple interest and compound interest calculator.

When you run the code, 
a dialog box appears and asks for SI or CI by buttons
» Simple interest which is (S)
» Compound Interest which is (C)
» Exit which is (E)

If you click (S) 
Now it will ask you:

Principal: The original sum of money which is borrowed in a loan or placed into an investment
Rate: The interest rate is the amount charged on top of the principal by a lender to a borrower for the use of assets.
Time: The number of years the money is invested or borrowed.

and will give the Simple Interest and Amount based on the data

Same for (S)
it will ask you same values and give the Compound Interest and Amount based on the data.


If you click (E), the dialog box will simply disappear.

This is my first project out there so facing bugs could be a possibility.
